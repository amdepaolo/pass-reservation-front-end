# Phase 3 Project Frontend
## Library Museum Pass Reservation Interface

This project was inspired by work at a public library that allows patrons to check out passes that grant admission to local museums and other similar sites.

It uses Javascript with React, and creates a way to interact with a database of passes and associated reservations. You can see a list of available passes and their reservations, add passes to the list, as well as create, edit, and delete reservations. 

There is an associated repo which handles the database on the backend for this project. That repo [is here](https://github.com/amdepaolo/phase-3-sinatra-react-project)
